# Montreal Robotics Summer School 2024
## Group 2 code implementation

This repo containes the code used by group 2 during the Montreal Robotics Summer School 2024. The code is based on the Unitree Go1 Edu robot and the Unitree Legged SDK.

The code is provided as is and is not guaranteed to work. (ðŸ¥²)
The group got the second place in the competition. (ðŸ¥³ (so the code should somehow work)).

## Competition Task

The competition was divided into three tires:

1. **Tire 1**: The robot should be able to walk in a straight line as fast as possible.

2. **Tire 2**: The robot should be able to walk in a maze as fast as possible while walikng over steps and ramps.

3. **Tire 3**: The robot should be able to walk in a maze as fast as possible while avoiding obstacles and should be able to reach a goal position in the maze. The maze contains AprilTags that the robot should be able to detect and use to localize.
